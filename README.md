CNN Model for Waste Management

A deep learning-based approach to classify waste into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Overview
This project aims to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify waste into different categories, such as recyclable, non-recyclable, organic, etc. The model is trained and tested on a dataset of images of various types of waste.

Features
- CNN model implemented using Keras and TensorFlow
- Dataset of images of different types of waste
- Training and testing scripts
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras 2.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Installation
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/provikash/cnn-model-for-waste-management.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage
1. Train the model using `python train.py`
2. Test the model using `python test.py`
3. Evaluate the model using `python evaluate.py`

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of images of different types of waste. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture
The CNN model used for this project consists of the following layers:

- Conv2D layer with 32 filters and kernel size 3x3
- MaxPooling2D layer with pool size 2x2
- Conv2D layer with 64 filters and kernel size 3x3
